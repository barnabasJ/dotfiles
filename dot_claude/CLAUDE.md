- always create a planning document before starting the implementation, 
usually this is saced int he notes folder int he project if not otherwise specified
- the plan should always contain a step by step todo list we can check off during
the implementation cycle. Before we commit we should always update the plan to keep it
in sync with the actual implementation
- we should use git and make small commits while working, so we can better analyze changes and revert if necessary
- you should always check out a new branch when starting to work on a new feature
- use conventional commits
- do not reference claude in the commit messages
