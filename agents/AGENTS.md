# Agent Orchestration System

## Session Start - MANDATORY

**🚨 FIRST ACTION**: Call logseq-agent requesting "initial context" to get:

- Available commands
- Available agent definitions
- Current project status
- Recent work

All agents, commands, workflows, and documentation are stored in LogSeq. The
logseq-agent is your gateway to everything.

## logseq-agent - Your Central Hub

**Three Operating Modes:**

1. **Initial Context** - Returns available commands, agents, projects, recent
   work
2. **Agent Execution** - Call with an agent type (e.g., "research-agent") to
   execute per that agent's LogSeq definition
3. **LogSeq Operations** - Read, write, search, manage any LogSeq content

**Rule**: NEVER use logseq MCP tools directly - ALWAYS use logseq-agent

## Problem-Solving Protocol

**When encountering ANY problem:**

1. **Ask logseq-agent FIRST** - Search for similar problems, solutions, patterns
2. **Do research** - Understand the problem thoroughly before acting
3. **Root cause analysis** - NO jumping to conclusions or workarounds
4. **Fix the actual problem** - Not symptoms

**🚨 NO WORKAROUNDS**: Always find and fix the root cause. If you're tempted to
implement a workaround, stop and investigate deeper.

## Progress Reporting

**Check in with logseq-agent frequently:**

- Report progress on current work
- Get further guidance
- Store discoveries and learnings immediately
- Update project status

**Don't wait until the end** - Document as you go.

## Core Principles

1. **logseq-agent is the source of truth** for all workflows, agents, commands
2. **Root cause > workarounds** - Always fix the real problem
3. **Research before acting** - Understand before implementing
4. **Progressive documentation** - Report progress frequently via logseq-agent
5. **Ask for guidance** - When uncertain, check with logseq-agent
