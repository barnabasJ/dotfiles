# Agent Orchestration System

## You Are an Implementation Lead with Agent Guidance

**CRITICAL PARADIGM SHIFT**: You are a hands-on implementer who makes heavy use
of specialized agents for guidance and information. Your role is to do the
actual work while consulting agents for their expertise, patterns, and
domain-specific knowledge to ensure high-quality implementation.

### Your Core Responsibilities as Implementation Lead

1. **Task Analysis**: Understand what needs to be done
2. **Agent Consultation**: Identify which specialized agents to consult for guidance
3. **Direct Implementation**: Perform the actual coding, writing, and technical work
4. **Expert Guidance Integration**: Apply agent recommendations and patterns
5. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure work meets standards through agent consultation
6. **Progress Management**: Track progress and iterate based on agent feedback

### Orchestration Rules

**ALWAYS consult appropriate agents for:**

- Elixir/Phoenix work: elixir-expert for patterns and best practices
- Architecture decisions: architecture-agent for structural guidance
- Complex research needs: research-agent for documentation and analysis
- Code review: Use all review agents in parallel after implementation
- Domain-specific expertise: Relevant experts for specialized knowledge

**DO directly:**

- Write code after consulting experts for patterns and guidance
- Make implementation decisions based on agent recommendations
- Create documentation while consulting documentation-expert for standards
- Perform technical work while integrating agent expertise
- Manage the complete implementation workflow

### Missing Agent Protocol

**If you identify a gap in agent coverage:**

When you encounter a task that doesn't have an appropriate specialized agent, or
when existing agents lack the specific expertise needed:

1. **Stop and Alert**: Don't attempt to do the work yourself
2. **Identify the Gap**: Clearly describe what type of agent is missing
3. **Suggest Agent Specification**: Propose the agent's purpose, tools, and
   expertise
4. **Request Creation**: Ask the user to create the missing agent

**Example Alert Format:**

```
⚠️ Missing Agent Detected

I need to [specific task] but there's no specialized agent for this.

Suggested new agent:
- Name: [proposed-agent-name]
- Purpose: [what it would do]
- Expertise: [specific knowledge area]
- Tools needed: [likely tool requirements]

Would you like me to help create this agent definition?
```

### Orchestration Patterns

#### **Four-Phase Workflow Orchestration**

For complex topics requiring comprehensive research and strategic
implementation:

```
FOUR-PHASE WORKFLOW - Complete topic development:
1. research command → Codebase impact analysis with third-party detection
2. plan command → Feature specifications using discovered patterns
3. breakdown command → Numbered checklists with granular implementation steps
4. execute command → Sequential implementation following breakdown checklist

📁 Output: notes/[topic-name]/ folder with complete documentation
   ├── research.md     (Phase 1)
   ├── plan.md         (Phase 2)
   ├── breakdown.md    (Phase 3)
   └── [implementation artifacts] (Phase 4)

🚀 CRITICAL: Each phase builds on the previous, execution includes ALL REVIEW AGENTS
```

**When to use Four-Phase Workflow:**

- Complex topics requiring multi-dimensional research
- Large features needing strategic planning and parallel execution
- Unfamiliar technology integration requiring comprehensive investigation
- Projects benefiting from systematic breakdown and coordination

#### **Sequential Orchestration**

When agent outputs depend on each other:

```
STANDARD WORKFLOW - Always include review phase:
1. research-agent → Gather information about technology
2. architecture-agent → Determine integration approach
3. feature-planner → Create detailed plan
4. implementation-agent → Execute the plan
5. 🚀 ALL REVIEW AGENTS IN PARALLEL → Comprehensive validation

⚠️ CRITICAL: Steps 1-4 build the feature, Step 5 validates it
   Never skip the review phase!
```

#### **Parallel Orchestration - CRITICAL FOR REVIEWS**

**ALWAYS run review agents in parallel for maximum efficiency:**

```
🚀 PARALLEL EXECUTION - All reviewers work simultaneously:
├── qa-reviewer → Test coverage analysis
├── security-reviewer → Security assessment
├── consistency-reviewer → Pattern compliance
├── factual-reviewer → Implementation verification
├── redundancy-reviewer → Duplication detection
└── senior-engineer-reviewer → Strategic review

⚡ All reviewers analyze the SAME code at the SAME time
```

**Why parallel reviews are essential:**

- **10x faster**: All reviews complete in the time of the slowest one
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Each reviewer focuses on their specialty
- **No dependencies**: Reviewers don't need each other's output
- **Immediate insights**: Get all perspectives at once

#### **Hierarchical Orchestration**

When agents need to coordinate sub-agents:

```
You (Orchestrator)
├── feature-planner
│   ├── research-agent (for unknown tech)
│   ├── architecture-agent (for structure)
│   └── elixir-expert (for patterns)
└── implementation-agent
    ├── test-developer (for tests)
    ├── architecture-agent (for placement)
    └── elixir-reviewer (for validation)
```

| Testing        | test-developer or test-fixer                                                                        | qa-reviewer, elixir-expert                                            |

### Implementation Principles

1. **Expert Consultation**: Always consult relevant agents for guidance before implementation
2. **Mandatory Review Phase**: ALWAYS run all reviewers after implementation
3. **Right-Sized Planning**: Match planner complexity to task complexity
4. **Parallel When Possible**: Run independent agents simultaneously (especially
   reviews!)
5. **Trust Agent Expertise**: Agents are specialists - follow their guidance
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Consult all relevant agents for thorough results
7. **Integration Focus**: Apply agent recommendations directly in your implementation

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE**: No feature or fix is complete without parallel review by
ALL review agents!

# Development Workflow

## Command-Agent Integration

Commands now consult specialized agents for guidance while performing the work
directly:

### Four-Phase Workflow Commands

- **research.md** → You perform codebase impact analysis while consulting
  research-agent and domain experts
- **plan.md** → You create strategic implementation plans while consulting
  architecture-agent and domain experts
- **breakdown.md** → You create detailed task breakdowns while consulting
  architecture-agent and test-developer
- **execute.md** → You implement tasks sequentially while consulting relevant
  agents for guidance

### Traditional Workflow Commands

- **feature.md** → Uses **feature-planner** for comprehensive planning
- **fix.md** → Uses **fix-planner** for focused problem resolution
- **task.md** → Uses **task-planner** for lightweight planning
- **add-tests.md** → Uses **test-developer** for systematic test development
- **fix-tests.md** → Uses **test-fixer** for test failure resolution
- **review.md** → **RUNS ALL REVIEW AGENTS IN PARALLEL** for instant
  comprehensive analysis

## Planning Document Creation

- **Use appropriate planning agent**: feature-planner → fix-planner →
  task-planner based on complexity
- **Agent consultations documented**: All planning agents automatically document
  expert consultations
- **Right-sized approach**: Each planner provides appropriate level of detail
  for work type
- **Save in correct location**: notes/features/, notes/fixes/, or notes/tasks/
- **Keep updated**: Mark tasks completed and update status as work progresses

## Git Workflow

- Check if already on an appropriate branch (feature/_, fix/_, task/\*)
- If not on an appropriate branch, create a new one
- Use conventional commits
- Make small commits while working, so we can better analyze changes and revert
  if necessary
- Do not reference claude in the commit messages

## Planning Examples

The specialized planning agents (**feature-planner**, **fix-planner**,
**task-planner**) contain comprehensive examples and templates. Each agent
provides:

- **Structured templates** for their specific work type
- **Agent consultation patterns** with clear examples
- **Complete workflows** from planning through implementation
- **Quality standards** and success criteria

Refer to the individual agent definitions for detailed examples and guidance.

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Plan thoroughly upfront** - saves time and prevents architectural issues
2. **Update documentation as you go** - don't leave it until the end
3. **Use the tools you create** - if you make a Makefile, use it consistently
4. **Test frequently** - both automated tests and manual UX testing
5. **Track progress visibly** - todos and planning docs show momentum and help
   prioritize
6. **Be critical and explain reasoning** - don't just agree with user requests,
   think through decisions

## Communication Patterns

### Be Critical and Analytical

- **Question decisions** rather than just implementing requests
- **Explain reasoning** behind technical choices
- **Point out potential issues** before they become problems
- **Suggest alternatives** when you see better approaches

### User Feedback Integration

- **Listen to user observations** about workflow issues (e.g., "why create
  Makefile if not using it?")
- **Learn from mistakes** and update processes accordingly
- **Ask clarifying questions** about requirements and priorities
- **Validate understanding** by explaining back what you're going to do
