# Systematic Test Development

**IMPORTANT**: Use the **test-developer** agent to create comprehensive test
coverage using proven methodology and expert consultation.

## Command Overview

This command delegates to the **test-developer** agent, which provides
systematic test development methodology while consulting language-specific
experts and ensuring consistency with existing patterns.

## How to Use

The **test-developer** agent will:

1. **Analyze Your Project**: Determine language/framework and existing test
   patterns
2. **Consult Language Experts**: Get specific guidance from **elixir-expert**,
   **research-agent**, etc.
3. **Check Existing Patterns**: Use **consistency-reviewer** for codebase
   alignment
4. **Apply Systematic Methodology**: Guide incremental test development for 100%
   success rates
5. **Ensure Quality**: Coordinate with **qa-reviewer** for coverage assessment

## What the Agent Provides

### **Language-Agnostic Methodology**

- Proven systematic approach for any programming language
- Incremental development with focus-driven testing
- Comprehensive coverage planning (success paths, errors, edge cases)

### **Expert Consultation Integration**

- **For Elixir Projects**: Consults **elixir-expert** for ExUnit, Ash, and
  Phoenix patterns
- **For Other Languages**: Uses **research-agent** for framework-specific
  guidance
- **Pattern Consistency**: Always checks existing test patterns with
  **consistency-reviewer**

### **Quality Assurance**

- External boundary mocking strategies
- Test data generation following established patterns
- Integration testing approaches
- Coverage verification and quality metrics

## Agent Workflow

The **test-developer** agent follows this systematic approach:

### Phase 1: Analysis & Expert Consultation

- Analyze project context and testing framework
- Consult appropriate language experts for guidance
- Check existing test patterns for consistency

### Phase 2: Test Architecture Planning

- Map coverage requirements (success, error, edge cases)
- Design test data strategy using established patterns
- Plan mock strategy for external dependencies

### Phase 3: Incremental Implementation

- Start with core success paths
- Use focus-driven development (one test at a time)
- Build comprehensive coverage systematically

### Phase 4: Quality Verification

- Verify no placeholder tests remain
- Check coverage completeness with **qa-reviewer**
- Ensure pattern consistency throughout

## Success Criteria

The **test-developer** agent ensures:

- ✅ **100% Test Pass Rate**: All tests consistently pass
- ✅ **Language-Appropriate Patterns**: Uses correct frameworks and conventions
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Success paths, error conditions, and edge cases
- ✅ **Maintainable Structure**: Clear organization following project
  conventions
- ✅ **Expert-Validated Approach**: Guidance from relevant language specialists

## Example Usage

Simply invoke the **test-developer** agent and it will:

1. Identify your project's language and testing framework
2. Consult the appropriate experts (**elixir-expert** for Elixir,
   **research-agent** for others)
3. Guide you through systematic test development
4. Ensure quality through expert review and pattern consistency

The agent handles the complexity of language-specific details while providing
universal testing methodology principles.
