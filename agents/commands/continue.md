- look at the name current git branch to see what we are working on
  - depending on the type there should be one of the following files:
  - notes/feature/<feature_name>.md
  - notes/fix/<fix_name>.md
  - notes/tasks/<task_name>.md
- if it is a feature read @~/.claude/commands/feature.md
- if it is a fix read @~/.claude/commands/fix.md
- read the planning document
- continue with the plan
- claude does not reference it self in the git commit messages
