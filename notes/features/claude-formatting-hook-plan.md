# Claude Code Formatting Hook Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

Currently, there's no automatic code formatting when Claude makes code changes through Edit, Write, and MultiEdit operations. This leads to:

- Inconsistent code formatting across the codebase
- Manual intervention required to format code after Claude changes
- Potential style guide violations that require manual correction
- Interruption of development flow to run formatters manually

The impact is particularly noticeable in projects with strict formatting requirements (Elixir with mix format, JavaScript/TypeScript with Prettier) where unformatted code can break CI/CD pipelines or create noisy diffs.

## Solution Overview

Implement a Claude Code formatting hook that automatically runs appropriate formatters after Edit, Write, and MultiEdit operations. The solution uses:

- **Hook Strategy**: PostToolUse hook that triggers after successful file modifications
- **Chezmoi Integration**: Same symlink pattern as AGENTS.md for settings file management
- **File Type Detection**: Simple extension-based detection for formatter selection
- **Non-blocking Execution**: Formatters run in background to avoid disrupting Claude
- **Error Resilience**: Formatting failures don't block Claude operations

Key design decisions:
- Use PostToolUse instead of PreToolUse to avoid blocking Claude operations
- Implement simple file extension matching rather than complex content analysis
- Prioritize reliability and performance over comprehensive language support
- Follow existing Chezmoi patterns for consistent dotfiles management

## Agent Consultations Performed

- **research-agent**: Researched Prettier and mix format CLI usage patterns, file type detection, and non-blocking execution strategies
- **elixir-expert**: Consulted for mix format best practices, performance considerations, and .formatter.exs integration patterns
- **architecture-agent**: Will consult for proper file placement and integration with existing Chezmoi structure

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
agents/
├── hooks/
│   └── format-code.sh           # Main formatting hook script
├── claude-settings.json         # Claude hook configuration
└── HOOKS-GUIDE.md              # (existing documentation)

dot_claude/
└── symlink_settings.json.tmpl   # Chezmoi symlink template
```

### Hook Configuration
- **Event**: PostToolUse
- **Matcher**: "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"
- **Target**: `~/.claude/settings.json` (symlinked from agents/claude-settings.json)

### File Type Detection
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`
- **Markdown**: `.md`, `.mdx`
- **Elixir**: `.ex`, `.exs`

### Dependencies
- **Prettier**: For JS/TS/Markdown formatting
- **Mix**: For Elixir formatting (assumes Elixir project context)
- **Standard shell utilities**: basename, dirname, grep for file detection

### Environment Variables
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`: Current project directory (provided by Claude)
- Standard shell environment variables

## Success Criteria

**CRITICAL COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

**No feature is complete without working tests:**
- Hook script must be tested with various file types and edge cases
- Configuration must be validated with Claude's settings parser
- Symlink creation must be tested with `chezmoi apply`
- Error handling must be tested for missing formatters or invalid files

**Feature Verification:**
- Code files are automatically formatted after Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
- Hook executes non-blocking (doesn't slow down Claude responses)
- Works with both Prettier (JS/TS/Markdown) and mix format (Elixir)
- Graceful handling when formatters are not available
- Settings file properly symlinked via Chezmoi
- No impact on Claude functionality when formatting fails

- [ ] Consult test-developer for end-to-end testing methodologies
- [ ] Verify hook works across different project types (pure JS, pure Elixir, mixed)
- [ ] Test hook behavior with files outside project directory
- [ ] Confirm non-blocking execution doesn't interfere with Claude operations
- [ ] Run comprehensive integration test suite
- [ ] Ensure 100% integration test coverage for implemented functionality
- [ ] Verify all tests pass consistently before feature completion

## Notes/Considerations

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
- **Missing formatters**: Hook should gracefully skip formatting if prettier or mix not available
- **File permissions**: Hook script needs proper execution permissions and file access
- **Path resolution**: Absolute paths needed for reliable hook execution
- **Project context**: mix format should only run in Elixir projects with mix.exs
- **Configuration conflicts**: User's existing .claude/settings.json might conflict with symlinked version

### Future Improvements and Extensibility
- Add support for additional formatters (rustfmt, gofmt, black for Python)
- Implement configuration file detection (.prettierrc, .formatter.exs) for formatter options
- Add selective formatting based on project type detection
- Consider adding pre-commit hook integration for broader development workflow

### Related Issues and Technical Debt
- May need to address existing .claude/settings.json if user has manual configuration
- Should coordinate with any future hook developments to avoid configuration conflicts
- Consider impact on CI/CD if formatting changes create unexpected diffs

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
- **Risk**: Hook failures could disrupt Claude operations
  - **Mitigation**: Non-blocking execution with comprehensive error handling
- **Risk**: Performance impact from formatter execution
  - **Mitigation**: Background execution and performance monitoring
- **Risk**: Configuration conflicts with user's existing settings
  - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and migration strategy for existing users
- **Risk**: Security implications of executing shell scripts
  - **Mitigation**: Input validation, safe file path handling, and restricted command execution

### Integration Considerations
- **Chezmoi Integration**: Follows established symlink patterns for consistency
- **Agent System**: Integrates with existing agents/ directory structure
- **Documentation**: Updates to HOOKS-GUIDE.md may be needed for usage examples
- **Version Control**: All hook components tracked in Chezmoi for cross-system consistency
