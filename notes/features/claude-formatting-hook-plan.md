# Claude Code Formatting Hook Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

Currently, there's no automatic code formatting when Claude makes code changes
through Edit, Write, and MultiEdit operations. This leads to:

- Inconsistent code formatting across the codebase
- Manual intervention required to format code after Claude changes
- Potential style guide violations that require manual correction
- Interruption of development flow to run formatters manually

The impact is particularly noticeable in projects with strict formatting
requirements (Elixir with mix format, JavaScript/TypeScript with Prettier) where
unformatted code can break CI/CD pipelines or create noisy diffs.

## Solution Overview

Implement a Claude Code formatting hook that automatically runs appropriate
formatters after Edit, Write, and MultiEdit operations. The solution uses:

- **Hook Strategy**: PostToolUse hook that triggers after successful file
  modifications
- **Chezmoi Integration**: Direct template integration in dot_claude/ directory
- **File Type Detection**: Extension-based detection for formatter selection
- **JSON stdin Processing**: Hook receives complete event data via stdin
- **Non-blocking Execution**: Formatters run in background to avoid disrupting
  Claude
- **Error Resilience**: Formatting failures don't block Claude operations

Key design decisions:

- Use PostToolUse instead of PreToolUse to avoid blocking Claude operations
- Process JSON event data from stdin rather than command-line arguments
- Use direct template processing instead of symlinks (Chezmoi limitation)
- Implement simple file extension matching rather than complex content analysis
- Prioritize reliability and performance over comprehensive language support

## Agent Consultations Performed

- **research-agent**: Researched Prettier and mix format CLI usage patterns,
  file type detection, and non-blocking execution strategies
- **elixir-expert**: Consulted for mix format best practices, performance
  considerations, and .formatter.exs integration patterns
- **architecture-agent**: Consulted for proper integration with existing Chezmoi
  structure

## Technical Details

### Final File Structure

```
agents/hooks/
├── debug-hook.sh                    # Debug/testing hook script
└── format-code.sh                   # Main formatting hook script

dot_claude/
└── settings.json.tmpl               # Chezmoi template (direct, not symlink)
```

### Hook Configuration

- **Event**: PostToolUse
- **Matcher**: "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"
- **Input**: Complete JSON event data via stdin
- **Target**: `~/.claude/settings.json` (generated from template)

### File Type Detection

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`
- **Markdown**: `.md`, `.mdx`
- **JSON**: `.json`
- **CSS/SCSS/Less**: `.css`, `.scss`, `.less`
- **HTML**: `.html`
- **YAML**: `.yaml`, `.yml`
- **Elixir**: `.ex`, `.exs`

### Dependencies

- **Prettier**: For JS/TS/Markdown/JSON/CSS/HTML/YAML formatting
- **Mix**: For Elixir formatting (assumes Elixir project context)
- **jq**: For parsing JSON stdin input
- **Standard shell utilities**: basename, dirname for file handling

### JSON Input Processing

Hook receives complete event data including:

- `tool_name`: The tool that was used (Edit, Write, MultiEdit)
- `file_path`: Path to the modified file
- Additional context and metadata

## Lessons Learned

### Key Implementation Discoveries

1. **Chezmoi Template Processing Limitation**

   - **Discovery**: Chezmoi doesn't process templates that are symlinked
   - **Impact**: Had to change from symlink approach (like AGENTS.md) to direct
     template
   - **Solution**: Created `dot_claude/settings.json.tmpl` with direct template
     processing
   - **Future Consideration**: All Claude settings must be templates, not
     symlinks

2. **Claude Hook JSON Input Processing**

   - **Discovery**: Claude hooks receive complete JSON event data via stdin, not
     command-line arguments
   - **Impact**: Initial hook design assumed command-line file path argument
   - **Solution**: Implemented jq-based JSON parsing to extract file_path from
     stdin
   - **Technical Detail**: Hook receives full event context including tool_name,
     file_path, and metadata

3. **Debug-First Development Approach**

   - **Discovery**: Understanding Claude's hook execution environment required
     iterative debugging
   - **Implementation**: Created debug-hook.sh first to log all input data and
     understand the format
   - **Benefit**: Debug script revealed JSON stdin structure and enabled proper
     hook development
   - **Best Practice**: Always create debug hooks first when developing Claude
     integrations

4. **Non-blocking Execution Requirements**
   - **Discovery**: Any hook failure or delay directly impacts Claude's response
     time
   - **Implementation**: Comprehensive error handling with guaranteed success
     exit codes
   - **Result**: Hook always exits 0 even when formatters fail or are missing
   - **User Impact**: Claude remains responsive regardless of formatting
     operations

### Technical Architecture Insights

1. **Path Resolution Strategy**

   - Used `{{ .chezmoi.sourceDir }}` template variable for cross-platform
     compatibility
   - Absolute paths required for reliable hook execution from Claude's context
   - Template approach provides better maintainability than hardcoded paths

2. **Error Handling Philosophy**

   - Prioritized Claude's functionality over formatting completeness
   - Graceful degradation when formatters unavailable
   - Extensive logging available via CLAUDE_FORMAT_DEBUG for troubleshooting

3. **File Type Detection Approach**
   - Simple extension-based matching proved sufficient and performant
   - Avoided complex content analysis to maintain hook execution speed
   - Easy to extend for additional file types in the future

### Development Workflow Improvements

1. **Testing Strategy**

   - Created debug-hook.sh for understanding Claude's execution environment
   - Iterative testing with real Claude operations rather than mock data
   - Comprehensive error scenario testing to ensure robustness

2. **Documentation Integration**
   - Updated HOOKS-GUIDE.md with JSON stdin input documentation
   - Provided clear examples for future hook development
   - Documented debugging techniques for hook development

## Notes/Considerations

### Successfully Handled Edge Cases

- **Missing formatters**: Hook gracefully skips formatting when prettier or mix
  not available ✅
- **File permissions**: Hook handles files with various permission levels ✅
- **Path resolution**: Absolute paths ensure reliable execution across
  environments ✅
- **Project context**: mix format only runs in Elixir projects with mix.exs ✅
- **JSON parsing errors**: Hook handles malformed stdin input gracefully ✅

### Future Improvements and Extensibility

- Add support for additional formatters (rustfmt, gofmt, black for Python)
- Implement file content-based detection for more accurate formatter selection
- Add configuration options for selective formatting by project type
- Consider adding formatter-specific configuration file detection

### Integration Success

- **Chezmoi Integration**: Successfully integrated with template-based
  configuration ✅
- **Agent System**: Properly organized within agents/hooks/ directory structure
  ✅
- **Documentation**: HOOKS-GUIDE.md updated with JSON stdin documentation ✅
- **Version Control**: All components tracked in Chezmoi for cross-system
  consistency ✅

### Risk Mitigation Achieved

- **✅ Hook failures don't disrupt Claude operations**: Non-blocking execution
  with guaranteed success exit codes
- **✅ No performance impact**: Background execution maintains Claude response
  times
- **✅ Configuration compatibility**: Template approach avoids conflicts with
  existing user settings
- **✅ Security considerations**: Input validation and safe file path handling
  implemented

## ✅ FEATURE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Final Status**: The Claude Code formatting hook is fully implemented, tested,
and operational. All success criteria have been met:

- ✅ Automatic formatting after Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
- ✅ Support for Prettier (JavaScript/TypeScript/Markdown/JSON/CSS/HTML/YAML)
  and mix format (Elixir)
- ✅ Non-blocking execution that doesn't impact Claude performance
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing formatters or invalid files
- ✅ Proper Chezmoi integration with template-based configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation across multiple scenarios

The feature is ready for production use and provides seamless code formatting
integration with Claude Code operations.
